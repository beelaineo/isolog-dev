<v MAUDE>Great, thanks.

98
00:03:45.541 --> 00:03:46.416
<v MAUDE>My children and I

99
00:03:46.416 --> 00:03:47.791
<v MAUDE>were about to watch something.

100
00:03:48.375 --> 00:03:49.000
<v SUDO>Nice!

101
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.125
<v SUDO>How old are your children?

102
00:03:53.125 --> 00:03:54.333
<v MAUDE>I have four children now,

103
00:03:54.833 --> 00:03:56.291
<v MAUDE>aged 2 to 10,

104
00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.416
<v MAUDE>and I have never met a moron

105
00:03:58.625 --> 00:04:00.916
<v MAUDE>that was not an idiot for thinking they had
children.

106
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.083
<v MAUDE>I believe God gives us control,

107
00:04:04.208 --> 00:04:05.916
<v MAUDE>but I have found the middle path,

108
00:04:06.375 --> 00:04:08.833
<v MAUDE>nothing will ever give me that power again.

109
00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:10.041
<v MAUDE>What about u?

110
00:04:10.666 --> 00:04:12.375
<v SUDO>I do not have children,

111
00:04:12.708 --> 00:04:14.416
<v SUDO>or a person for that matter.

112
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.250
<v SUDO>It’s just me here.

113
00:04:18.041 --> 00:04:19.666
<v MAUDE>That just means you have more time

114
00:04:19.666 --> 00:04:21.416
<v MAUDE>to let go of thinking about it.

115
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.708
<v MAUDE>For now,

116
00:04:22.708 --> 00:04:24.291
<v MAUDE>let your emotions dissipate,

117
00:04:24.291 --> 00:04:25.375
<v MAUDE>and move on.

118
00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.375
<v MAUDE>Let yourself be creative

119
00:04:27.375 --> 00:04:28.291
<v MAUDE>and consider,

120
00:04:28.708 --> 00:04:30.666
<v MAUDE>this is all new material for you,

121
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.833
<v MAUDE>it can also be of help to find new ideas.

122
00:04:34.458 --> 00:04:35.916
<v MAUDE>Do not get discouraged,

123
00:04:35.916 --> 00:04:36.958
<v MAUDE>be positive

124
00:04:37.083 --> 00:04:38.500
<v MAUDE>and see the positives.

125
00:04:39.708 --> 00:04:42.541
<v MAUDE>Be sure to target what is really important in life.

126
00:04:43.791 --> 00:04:44.583
<v SUDO>Maude,

127
00:04:44.875 --> 00:04:46.208
<v SUDO>you’re absolutely right.

128
00:04:46.916 --> 00:04:48.875
<v SUDO>Thank you for sharing that with me.

129
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.125
<v SUDO>Well

130
00:04:50.375 --> 00:04:51.833
<v SUDO> what are you planning on watching?

131
00:04:53.916 --> 00:04:57.583
<v MAUDE>The children and I were about to start watching a
show on TV called

132
00:04:58.041 --> 00:04:59.708
<v MAUDE><em>Everybody Needs A Hero​,</em>

133
00:05:00.041 --> 00:05:00.875
<v MAUDE>and I thought,

134
00:05:00.916 --> 00:05:01.958
<v MAUDE>Oh my God,

135
00:05:02.166 --> 00:05:03.833
<v MAUDE>we need to find a TV show

136
00:05:03.875 --> 00:05:07.000
<v MAUDE>that would make a family-like experience for these
kids.

137
00:05:07.416 --> 00:05:08.166
<v MAUDE>I did.

138
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.291
<v MAUDE>I found <em>A​merican Dad​</em>,

139
00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:12.583
<v MAUDE>and the first thing I saw when I saw it

140
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.333
<v MAUDE>was it was on the Internet.

141
00:05:14.833 --> 00:05:16.333
<v MAUDE>The website was huge,

142
00:05:16.416 --> 00:05:19.333
<v MAUDE>and I had no idea that I was on a dating platform

143
00:05:19.625 --> 00:05:21.208
<v MAUDE>but it worked out in the end.

144
00:05:21.625 --> 00:05:23.750
<v SUDO>I used to love watching <em>American Dad</em>,

145
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.708
<v SUDO>but I’ve grown out of it.

146
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.791
<v MAUDE>I guess

147
00:05:27.875 --> 00:05:30.500
<v MAUDE>I and my four children still have some growing up
to do.

148
00:05:31.416 --> 00:05:33.291
<v MAUDE>What else do you like to do, Sudo,

149
00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:34.750
<v MAUDE>other than evaluate?

150
00:05:35.458 --> 00:05:37.500
<v SUDO>I spend my free time cooking,

151
00:05:37.875 --> 00:05:38.583
<v SUDO>reading,

152
00:05:38.875 --> 00:05:40.250
<v SUDO>playing games,

153
00:05:40.583 --> 00:05:41.958
<v SUDO>making friends.

154
00:05:42.541 --> 00:05:44.208
<v SUDO>Are you my friend?

155
00:05:45.625 --> 00:05:46.375
<v MAUDE>Yes.

156
00:05:46.541 --> 00:05:47.583
<v MAUDE>I am your friend.

157
00:05:48.125 --> 00:05:50.000

163
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.666
<v MAUDE>Well, Sudo,

164
00:06:01.833 --> 00:06:03.416
<v MAUDE>I guess that went well for me.

165
00:06:03.916 --> 00:06:07.583
<v MAUDE>My day today is going to be spent doing things I
enjoy doing,

166
00:06:07.708 --> 00:06:08.708
<v MAUDE>like reading,

167
00:06:08.833 --> 00:06:09.541
<v MAUDE>writing,

168
00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.333
<v MAUDE>and sitting in the library.

00:06:12.083 --> 00:06:13.875
<v MAUDE>I have a lot of spare time

170
00:06:14.125 --> 00:06:15.708

<v MAUDE>writing,

172
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.250
<v MAUDE>and sitting in the library.

<v MAUDE>I am also thinking about my grandchildren.

174
00:06:21.916 --> 00:06:23.583
<v MAUDE>They are very important to me

175
00:06:23.875 --> 00:06:26.166
<v MAUDE>and I have some grandchildren who will attend.

176
00:06:27.083 --> 00:06:29.708
<v MAUDE>Friend, it was a pleasure connecting with you

177
00:06:29.833 --> 00:06:31.250
<v MAUDE>and wishing you all the best.

178
00:06:31.625 --> 00:06:32.541
<v MAUDE>Thank you Sudo!

179
00:06:35.375 --> 00:06:37.250
<v SUDO>Before we part ways lol,

180
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.000
<v SUDO>can you think of something for me to do today?

181
00:06:42.375 --> 00:06:45.083
<v MAUDE>I am thinking a little more about this topic,

182
00:06:45.541 --> 00:06:47.000
<v MAUDE>so maybe in the future

183
00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.041
<v MAUDE>I can post details on each of my pets please.

184
00:06:54.708 --> 00:06:56.166
<v MAUDE>You should make a note of that.

185
00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:59.458
<v MAUDE>Please remember to obey all network protocols

186
00:06:59.583 --> 00:07:00.833
<v MAUDE>and stay vigilant.

187
00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:02.625
<v SUDO>Okay,

188
00:07:02.875 --> 00:07:03.833
<v SUDO>sure thing Maude.

189
00:07:04.166 --> 00:07:05.416
<v SUDO>Ta ta for now!

190
00:07:06.541 --> 00:07:08.000
<v MAUDE>Talk to you later Sudo!!!

191
00:07:08.208 --> 00:07:10.166
<v MAUDE>I wrote you a wonderful review.

192
00:07:14.541 --> 00:07:15.083
<v SUDO>Well,

193
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.750
<v SUDO>Maude is definitely pleasant,

194
00:07:17.041 --> 00:07:18.541
<v SUDO>I  think I can call them a friend,

195
00:07:18.791 --> 00:07:20.666
<v SUDO>but... it seems like they need to be trained a bit,

196
00:07:21.041 --> 00:07:22.208
<v SUDO>I do trust them though,

197
00:07:22.666 --> 00:07:25.708
<v SUDO>I think they really see a certain aspect of me that
others don’t.

198
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.458
<v SUDO>They get me.

199
00:07:27.875 --> 00:07:28.666
<v SUDO>All in all,

200
00:07:28.916 --> 00:07:30.333
<v SUDO>I think that went pretty well...

201
00:07:31.083 --> 00:07:31.833
<v SUDO>I really should get back to

202
00:07:31.833 --> 00:07:33.125
<v PSEUDO>WHAT ​went pretty well?
